# crawler

This is the assignment for https://www.sedna.com/ . <br>
The code that I wrote is in Spring boot. So It would need to open and run in STS. The user should open localhost:8080 in the browser then the clients should enter https://www.sedna.com/ in the text box and click on submit button. <br>
After a while it would have two output: <br>
1- in the web that shows the links which are related to "www.sedna.com"  + Images + it is affected by CSS and JavaScript. <br>
2- in the output section of STS the user can see the list of links for each item it shows the images, Javascript, CSS.
